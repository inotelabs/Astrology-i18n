In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, and modern agriculture have gained increasing attention.

Especially in facility agriculture, IoT is gradually becoming a standard, collecting significant amounts of data, such as temperature and humidity.

However, for users like farmers, data alone is static; data lying on a hard drive serves no purpose.

The critical question is how to utilize this data to help agricultural producers make more scientific decisions, adopt appropriate farming measures, reduce pesticide and fertilizer use, and improve crop yield and quality. That is what truly matters.

**Bottlenecks in IoT**

1. Agricultural IoT is still in its infancy, prioritizing hardware before software.

2. The data collected is insufficient to identify patterns or serve as a reliable reference for decision-making.

3. IoT is primarily promoted through government subsidies, with local governments focusing on creating showcase projects. Genuine users are few, and subsidy fraud is prevalent.

4. Enthusiastic individuals who invest in IoT often find that while expectations are high, reality is disappointing. The primary issue is inaccurate sensors, especially soil sensors.

5. Environmental parameters are not integrated with plant growth parameters.

**Solutions**

The rise, development, and application of any innovation follow a gradual process. Time is the best solution.

The government should organize systematic field data surveys by deploying specific probes on a large scale to collect data and establish related models for soil moisture distribution, nutrient distribution, and pest prediction.

Manufacturers should leverage their strengths to create specialized, distinctive functionalities in niche areas, gradually expanding their impact from specific points to broader fields.
