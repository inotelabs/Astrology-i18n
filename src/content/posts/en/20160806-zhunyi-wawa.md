I had the privilege of visiting the "Zunyi Conference Memorial Hall" located at No. 96, Old City Yinqiao Road, Zunyi, Guizhou. While reflecting on the difficult journey of the Long March undertaken by the 25,000 Red Army soldiers, I also came across several interesting propaganda posters created by the Red Army at the time.

**Hand-Tearing Japanese Soldiers**

The scene of "hand-tearing Japanese soldiers" from the drama _Anti-Japanese Hero_ has been heavily criticized by both official media and self-media outlets. Due to its exaggerated and highly unrealistic plot, the show has been crowned as the quintessential "anti-Japanese propaganda drama."

However, within the Zunyi Conference Memorial Hall, I found a propaganda poster that served as the prototype for the "hand-tearing Japanese soldiers" idea. But instead of focusing on tearing apart Japanese soldiers, the poster was titled _"Brother White Army, how many times a day do you get beaten by the officials?"_ It was a propaganda illustration aimed at the plight of the people under the rule of the White Army.

**Hand-Tearing Siwawa**

Speaking of "hand-tearing Japanese soldiers," I was reminded of a popular local snack in Zunyi called "hand-tearing Siwawa." While the name might sound intimidating, it is essentially a vegetarian spring roll. The rice-based skin is wrapped around various ingredients like shredded radish and bean sprouts, then drenched in a spicy and tangy sauce. The taste is absolutely delightful.

**Other Propaganda Slogans**

The Zunyi Conference Memorial Hall also exhibited several other slogans from the time of the Red Army, which were simple yet profoundly impactful. They targeted the hearts of peasants, workers, and lower-level Nationalist officers, urging unity. These slogans can serve as valuable material for modern advertisers and marketing strategists looking for inspiration in their own work.
