The pace in the first week of May was manageable, but the recent regulatory tightening on finance, along with sectors like the Belt and Road Initiative, Xiong’an New Area, and newly listed stocks, has increased operational difficulty. Instead of engaging in all three sectors, it’s better to focus solely on the Xiong’an sector. Today’s losses were mainly due to yesterday’s foray into the newly listed stock Lisheng Racing. Avoid the Belt and Road Initiative stocks and instead delve deeper into Xiong’an stocks. For example, even though Juyou Tools continues to climb, it’s likely due to large-scale trading by major shareholders, who are using this opportunity to sell at a high. It's better not to get involved. Similarly, previous picks like Yinlong Stock should also be avoided for now.

Han Jian Heshan, the local concrete leader and the real standout in the Xiong’an theme, looks promising. However, it is currently in the chip realization phase, so it's best to wait for a pullback before participating.

The broader market has fallen for four consecutive weeks and is likely to rebound soon. Who will lead the rebound? According to Anpingtai, the bulls are still divided and lack cohesion. However, with the Xiong’an concept as part of a larger cycle, it is expected to rebound and surge further after the May 14 Belt and Road meeting. For this week, consider low-point entries on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th.

**PS:** Stocks selected yesterday, Beixin Road and Guangzheng Group, were not purchased. Although Guangzheng hit the limit-up, it holds little significance. Focusing on the major theme of Xiong’an remains the priority.
